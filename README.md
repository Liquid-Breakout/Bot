## :warning: This is a W.I.P. project! :warning:
The current backend will still be used for now.
  
Despite the repo name being "Bot", this branch is only for Backend. It will be renamed soon.
## So.... what is this exactly?
This is a reimplementation of LB's Backend, made in Rust.
## Why Rust? Node.js was fine.
Yeah.............. except it's RAM-consuming, slow, and the toolings just aifhaiuwfhwafa.
Rust, while yes it's pretty low-level, guarantees memory-safety and I have heard it can handle more requests, so there's that.
## How can I contribute?
While I know the team isn't capable of doing Rust things, you can at least help me test out, suggest features. And stuffs.
## Compiling
Make sure to have Rust installed, and then you can do
  
` cargo build `
  
And then it will compile an executable for you.
